# 3D_Rotating_Minecraft_Block_Demo
This is a 3D demo program written by me in C++ with OpenGL library. It shows an animation of a rotating minecraft block. It can be loaded with different textures to represent different blocks!  

This project was completed on 10/24/2018, and was only uploaded to my Github account recently 

Here is a demo for a rotating stone block:

What I am most proud of this project is that I did all the 3D camera projection and vector calculation by myself without using any library.
I figured out the projection calculation using knowledge learned from linear algebra and computer vision.
