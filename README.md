# 3D_Rotating_Minecraft_Block_Demo
This is a 3D demo program written by me in C++ with OpenGL library. It shows an animation of a rotating minecraft block. It can be loaded with different 
texture picture to represent different blocks!  
Here is an example of a serious of screen shots taken when running my program with stone texture

What I am most proud of this project is that I did all the 3D camera projection and vector calculation by myself without using any library.
I figured out the projection calculation using knowledge learned from linear algebra and computer vision.
